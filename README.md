<h1>Winnipeg Fire and Paramedic Call Data Analysis</h1>

<p>This project is an analysis of call data from fire and paramedic services in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The dataset includes information about the type of calls, the neighborhoods in which they occurred, the date and time they were received, and the wards that responded to the incidents. To perform this analysis, a combination of SQL in PostgreSQL and Python was used for data cleaning and organization.</p>

<h2>Key Objectives:</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Data Cleaning:</strong></li>
    -Python scripts were employed to clean and organize the raw call data, ensuring data consistency and quality.
  <li><strong>SQL Analysis:</strong></li>
    -SQL queries were used to extract valuable insights from the dataset. These insights include call volumes, average response times, call type distribution, and patterns of call occurrence during specific time frames.
  <li><strong>Time Series Analysis:</strong></li>
    -The project also includes time series analysis to identify trends and patterns in call data over different time periods.
</ol>

<h2>Skills and Tools:</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>SQL (PostgreSQL)</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Python for data cleaning and processing</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Data Analysis and Visualization</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>This project provides a valuable demonstration of your ability to work with real-world data, clean and structure it, and use SQL to perform data analysis. It offers insights into the patterns and trends of fire and paramedic calls in Winnipeg, which can have practical implications for improving emergency services in the area.</p>
